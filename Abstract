The Smart Device for Cloth Protection from Rain is an automated system designed to safeguard clothes from unexpected rainfall, addressing a common challenge faced in outdoor drying scenarios. The device employs a rain sensor to detect precipitation and an Arduino Uno microcontroller to process sensor inputs and control the mechanism. A servo motor, activated via an IC555 timer, operates a rope mechanism to deploy or retract a protective cover over the clothes. Additionally, a temperature sensor monitors weather conditions to enhance system adaptability and efficiency. This innovative solution is energy-efficient, user-friendly, and ensures convenience by eliminating manual intervention. The project aims to provide a practical, cost-effective, and reliable solution to protect clothes from rain, making it an ideal choice for both residential and commercial applications.
